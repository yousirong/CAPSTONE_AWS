Although large corporations have established sales databases for efficient sales
activities, small-scale entrepreneurs need a system that provides an interface that anyone
can easily manage, offering diverse and complex information. This paper proposes the use
of React technology, which can also operate on crawling servers that automatically collect
store information. Furthermore, it suggests the development of a responsive web user interface that can be conveniently used in both mouse and keyboard-based desktop environments as well as touch-based smartphone environments, utilizing React technology for the
effective delivery of various data. The proposed methods anticipate rapid retrieval of large
volumes of data due to the adoption of asynchronous function processing in React technology, an improvement over traditional JavaScript methods.
